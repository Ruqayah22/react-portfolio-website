- This line defines a CSS custom property (also known as a CSS variable) named --transition.
- all: This means that all properties of the element that can transition will do so.
- 400ms: This specifies the duration of the transition, which is 400 milliseconds.
- ease: This is the timing function for the transition, which determines how the speed of the transition changes over time. The ease function starts slow, speeds up, and then slows down again at the end.
